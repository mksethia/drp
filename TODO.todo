DONE: remove CLUBS from top right of the website (and disable sign in for now)

Remove map in the beginning: should appear after a search
Title should not be clubs: should be like a slogan or something
Flesh out three football clubs:
 -> opening hours, training times, costs, descriptions, images, facitilities ...
better ui: fonts, colours, animations, 
on landing page seach bar should be behind an image / blurred image ? 
Copy jitty in other ways.
